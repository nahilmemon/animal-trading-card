			<!-- Animal's description -->
			<p>Arctic wolves are the only species of wolves that are almost completely white. They live mostly in Alaska, but small populations live in Canada and Greenland as well. They have small ears to help regulate their body temperature and padded paws to allow them good grip while walking on icy surfaces.</p>
